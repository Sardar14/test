Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
